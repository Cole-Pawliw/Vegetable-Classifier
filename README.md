# Vegetable-Classifier
A program using TensorFlow to classify images of vegetables.

This was created as a final project in my machine learning class. It uses a neural network to classify any given image as one of 15 different vegetables.

The Folder of images contains over 21,000 images so I do not recommend downloading this project.
